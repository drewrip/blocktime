## Dependencies:


[Bitcoin JSON API](https://github.com/minium/bitcoin-api-cpp)


## Compilation:

```
./buildsolo.sh
```


** Notes: **

The only programs that actively work and were used for testing, were the [buildsolo.sh](https://github.com/drewrip/blocktime/blob/master/buildsolo.sh), [solo.cpp](https://github.com/drewrip/blocktime/blob/master/solo.cpp), and [finale.sh](https://github.com/drewrip/blocktime/blob/master/finale.sh)



Also the program [AttackerSimulation.cpp](https://github.com/drewrip/blocktime/blob/master/AttackerSimulation.cpp) was used for analysis. It is a quick bit of C++ code adapted from the orginal C code provided by Satoshi Nakamoto in his whitepaper.
